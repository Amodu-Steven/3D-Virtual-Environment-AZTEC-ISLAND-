# Interactive Visualization Assignment - Aztec Island VR Environment

 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQvEaY2AXjE&t=125s)



<h2>Description</h2>
This project involves creating an immersive virtual reality environment called "Aztec Island" using Unity. The 3D world is an educational experience that teaches users about Aztec civilization through interactive exploration, maze navigation, and puzzle-solving. Players collect rings, avoid obstacles, and learn about Aztec history while navigating through three distinct scenes.
